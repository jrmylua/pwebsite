              <p style="font-size:19px">Music has always been one of the most important parts of my life.
                Early in my childhood, I learned how to play the piano, which built the musical foundation that lead to learning to play the violin
                and guitar. Throughout elementary school, middle school, and high school,
                I actively participated in the school orchestras, however in college I decided to try something new - acapella.<br>
              I always enjoyed singing as a child, but never took singing seriously. One day during senior year of high school, however, I decided to make a cover with one of my friends, and
            received surprising amounts of positive feedback from it. Ever since, I started creating more song covers which are all displayed on this page for your enjoyment. </p>

My Tylenol when I'm in pain yeah
Let me tell you what she means to me
Like a tall glass of lemonade
When it's burning hot on summer days
She's exactly what I need

She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
And she helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need

She's my smile when I'm feeling blue
She's my good night sleep when the day is through yeah
Let me tell you what she means to me
(She's kinda like this)
Kinda like the feeling after your first kiss
Except that everyday she makes me feel like this
She's exactly what I need
Oh yeah

She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
And she helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need

She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
She helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need

I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime running
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay

I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in running
This is something I gotta face

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus:]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus:]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

The writing's on the wall

[Chorus:]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall</pre>

[Meghan Trainor:]
I found myself dreaming
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone

I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you

[John Legend:]
In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know

So I'll kiss you longer, baby
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets

Let's take our time
To say what we want
Use what we got
Before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow

[Both:]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you

Hey
Whoa

I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you

Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home [4x]

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
"Wait for me to come home."</pre>

I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

[Verse 1:]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus:]
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus:]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

[Pre-Chorus:]
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus:]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh

[Bridge:]
Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus:]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh</pre>

You're not the type, type of girl to remain
With the guy, with the guy
Too shy, too afraid to say he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy who will fall to his knees
With his hands clasped tight
Begging, begging you please
To stay with him for worse or for better

But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me

[Chorus:]
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

In the past I would try
Try hard to commit to a girl
Wouldn't get too far
It always somehow seemed to fall apart

But with you, you, you
I can see what I need
I can dream realistically
I knew that this was different from the start

And it seems that every time
We're eye to eye
I can find another piece of you
That I don't wanna lose

And I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl I need

[Chorus:]
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

And it's never easy
Darling, believe me
I'm as skeptical as you
When I think of life without "us"
It seems like "What we're supposed to do? "
But I don't wanna come on too strong

[Chorus:]
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
We can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
It's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If we never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me</pre>

Nice guys finish last
That's why I'll treat you like trash.
It's not what I really wanna do.
But you only date bad guys
So I'll give you my best try
To treat you the way you want me to.

I never open a door
Or pull out a chair
You can tell me how your day was
But I don't really care
And if you ever get cold
You'll just have to hack it
Cause I'd be cold too
If I gave you my jacket

Like whoa
You ain't sitting up front
Front is for the homies,
You can sit in the trunk
I never answer my phone
Whenever you call it
And when the waiter brings the bill
I never reach for my wallet

Nice guys finish last
That's why I'll treat you like trash.
It's not what I really want to do.
But you only date bad guys
So I'll give you my best try
To treat you the way you want me to

And I'mma beat you
In every competition
Going out with the girls,
You better get my permission
Wait no!
I take that back, you can't go
House is on tonight
And that's my favorite show

"Do I look fat in this dress?"
Hell, yeah! You do!
Wait, let me speak your language
Cows go mooo, mooo, mooo, mooo, mooo

Nice guys finish last
That's why I'll treat you like trash
It's not what I really want to do
Oh, you only date bad guys
So I'll give you my best try
To treat you the way you want me to

But behind the scenes
She means the world to me
I wanna tell her that she's beautiful
And show her that she's loved
Hold her hand when she's scared
Tell her how much I care
But that won't win her heart because...

Nice guys finish last
That's why I'll treat you like trash
It's not what I really want to do.
Oh, you only date bad guys

My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says, "Boy, quit fooling around"
I told her, "I love the view from up here
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love"

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Yeah, sway to the rhythm of love

Sunday morning rain is falling
Shed some cover share some skin
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends
But things just get so crazy that living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

I wanna float on this cloud with you
I need to see you in darkness too
or I could paint you in stormy rain
on a crazy sunday
I wanna float on this cloud with you
I need to see you in darkness too
or I could paint you in stormy rain
on a crazy sunday

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave</pre>

Little do you know
How I'm breaking while you fall asleep
Little do you know
I'm still haunted by the memories
Little do you know
I'm tryna pick myself up piece by piece

Little do you know
I need a little more time

Underneath it all I'm held captive by the hole inside
I've been holding back for the fear that you might change your mind
I'm ready to forgive you but forgetting is a harder fight

Little do you know
I need a little more time

I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain
I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait
The love is here and here to stay
So lay your head on me

Little do you know
I know you're hurting while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are slowly drowning me
Little do you know
I'm trying to make it better piece by piece

Little do you know
I, I love you 'til the sun dies

Oh wait, just wait
I love you like I've never felt the pain
Just wait
I love you like I've never been afraid
Just wait
Our love is here and here to stay

(feat. Jesse Barrera)

[Jesse:]
So I hopped on a train,
Three in the afternoon,
I don't know when I'm coming back,
But I hope that it's soon,
See I never thought, never thought, that I'd have to leave your side, your side.

[AJ:]
It's only physically,
But know that you will be on my mind,
Twenty four hours at a time,
'Cause in my eyes you were mine, you were mine.

[Both:]
No matter where you go,
I won't be very far,
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are,
'Cause love has no distance baby,
Love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and me.

[AJ:]
See she wrote me a letter,
Said the weather wasn't better,
But she said that she was doing fine,
I wanna see you face to face,
That's what she wrote to me that day,
And I knew that it was all a sign.

[Jesse:]
So I wrote back with this song,
Promise it won't be too long,
Wanna make up for all our lost time,
'Cause in my eyes you were mine, you were mine.

[Both:]
No matter where you go,
I won't be very far,
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are,
'Cause love has no distance baby,
Love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and me.

[Jesse:]
So I'm going through these boxes.
My life's gone off track.
'Cause it's been three years.
She hasn't written back.
But in my eyes.
She's still mine.

[AJ:]
And I know it sounds so stupid,
To be waiting this long,
But I'm still in love and I know I'm not wrong,
'Cause in my eyes,
She was mine.

[Both:]
No matter where you go,
I won't be very far,
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are,
'Cause love has no distance baby,
Love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and

No matter where you go,
I won't be very far,

Love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and me.</pre>
